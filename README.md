## About me
I used to be a pastry chef for ten years, and the covid gave me lot of time to think about my future, that's how I've discovered the wonderful world of programming. I started by the famous pool of 42 school, and so, I keep learning everyday all these language ❤️
- 🔭 I’m currently a student at  **42 school**, in Lyon, France
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **C** and **CPP** language
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I'll always be happy to help if I can
- 🤔 I’m looking for almost everything for now. What can I do for you? Cakes 🎂
